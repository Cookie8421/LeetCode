/**
 * Given two integers num1 and num2, return the sum of the two integers.
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: num1 = 12, num2 = 5
 * Output: 17
 * Explanation: num1 is 12, num2 is 5, and their sum is 12 + 5 = 17, so 17 is returned.
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: num1 = -10, num2 = 4
 * Output: -6
 * Explanation: num1 + num2 = -6, so -6 is returned.
 *
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 *     -100 <= num1, num2 <= 100
